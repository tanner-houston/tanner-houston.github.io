## Welcome!

My name is Tanner Houston. I am a 2nd year doctoral student in the Health Policy (Management) program at Harvard Business School.

My research focuses on competitive strategy specific to the healthcare setting and is grounded in organizational economics. My current interest is in understanding persistent performance differences across hospitals that are within the same health system chain.

At some stage I will host my research articles here, so stay tuned for more to come.

Also, check out the **About Me** section to learn more of my interest outside of academia!
